# pyfetch
A small module for learning Python, and posting information about my system.

I've tested it on my Linux Mint computer, and it works with python3. There's no error checking. I just wrote it to learn about Python.
My next version will be GUI.

run it like this: python3 pyfetch.py

or make it executable: chmod +x pyfetch.py and then run it like this: ./pyfetch.py
even better: echo $PATH
and then copy the file somewhere in the path, maybe /usr/bin
and then rename it to "pyfetch" - and now it will run from anywhere as "pyfetch".
